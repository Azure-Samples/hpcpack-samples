 # Introduction
 This sample will submit jobs every 2 seconds to the cluster. It will stop doing so when the scheduler is disconnected. Disconnect by ending process HpcScheduler.exe (In Task Manageer -> More Details -> Details tab -> find HpcScheduler.exe -> End Task). HpcScheduler.exe will restart automatically after a while. Then, it will submits jobs again.
